# Gradient Forest
To investigate the effects of spatial environmental variation on patterns of genomic diversity among *T. affinis* populations, we used gradient forest [Ellis *et al.* 2012, *Ecology*](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/11-0252.1) to quantify allele frequency - environment associations. Code follows closely the vignette example for gradientForest by C. Roland Pitcher, Nick Ellis, and Stephen J. Smith, 2014, except for species-specific additions and code used to assess observed reactions as compared to random pairings of predictors and responses. R code used in the gradientForest analysis is provided as skinkforest.R.
