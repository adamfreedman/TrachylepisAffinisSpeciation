# TrachylepisAffinisSpeciation
This repository contains methods and code used in analyses for our manuscript **Ecotone Speciation Across an African Rainforest-Savanna Gradient**, that is currently under review. Through a comprehensive demographic analysis of RAD-seq data from 14 populations in Cameroon and Gabon, we present genomic evidence for ecotone speciation in equatorial Africa in a rainforest skink, *Tracylepis affinis*. Specifically, we document the recent termination of gene flow between rainforest and ecotone populations, between which there is both morphological and physiological divergence. This is the first documented case of ecologically driven rainforest-ecotone speciation in an African vertebrate species.
