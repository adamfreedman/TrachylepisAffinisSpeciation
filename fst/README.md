# F<sub>ST</sub>
To quantify genetic differentiation among our 14 sampled *T. affinis* populations, we calculate both [Weir and Cockerham's F<sub>ST</sub>](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2408641) among all pairs of populations using [VCFTOOLS](https://vcftools.github.io/index.html), version 0.1.14, and also derived from these estimates [Slaktin's linearized F<sub>ST</sub>](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/139/1/457/6013188) as F<sub>ST</sub>/(1-F<sub>ST</sub>). We obtained F<sub>ST</sub> on both filtered and unfiltered genotypes. See [variant_filtering](https://github.com/adamfreedman/TrachylepisAffinisSpeciation/tree/master/variant_filtering) page for details regarding the filtering schema. For the filtered data, a data table and Rscript for producing Figure S1 panels A and C in our manusript are provided in the data and Rscripts directories, respectively.
